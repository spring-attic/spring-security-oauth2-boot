= OAuth2 Boot

If you have `spring-security-oauth2` on your classpath, you can take advantage of some
auto-configuration to simplify setting up Authorization and Resource Servers. For full
details, see the https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/docs/oauth2.html[Spring
Security OAuth 2 Developers Guide].

[NOTE]
====
The following projects are in maintenance mode:

* `spring-security-oauth2`
* `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`

You are, of course, welcome to use them, and we will help you out!

However, before selecting `spring-security-oauth2` and `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`,
you should check out https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Features-Matrix[Spring Security's feature matrix] to see if the new first-class support meets your needs.
====

[NOTE]
====
This project is a port of the Spring Security OAuth support that came with Spring Boot 1.x.
Support was removed in Spring Boot 2.x in favor of https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2client[Spring Security 5's first-class OAuth support].

To ease migration, this project exists as a bridge between the old Spring Security OAuth
support and Spring Boot 2.x.

[[boot-features-security-oauth2-authorization-server]]
== Authorization Server

Spring Security OAuth2 Boot simplifies standing up an OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server.

=== Do I Need to Stand Up My Own Authorization Server?

You need to stand up your own authorization server if:

* You want to delegate the operations of sign-in, sign-out, and password recovery to a separate service (also called _identity federation_) that you want to manage yourself and
* You want to use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for this separate service to coordinate with other services

=== Dependencies

To use the auto-configuration features in this library, you need `spring-security-oauth2`, which has the OAuth 2.0 primitives and `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`.
Note that you need to specify the version for `spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`, since it is not managed by Spring Boot any longer, though it should match Boot's version anyway.

For JWT support, you also need `spring-security-jwt`.

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-minimal]]
=== Minimal OAuth2 Boot Configuration

Creating a minimal Spring Boot authorization server consists of three basic steps:

. Including the dependencies.
. Including the `@EnableAuthorizationServer` annotation.
. Specifying at least one client ID and secret pair.

==== Enabling the Authorization Server

Similar to other Spring Boot `@Enable` annotations, you can add the `@EnableAuthorizationServer` annotation to the class that contains your `main` method, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableAuthorizationServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class SimpleAuthorizationServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SimpleAuthorizationServerApplication, args);
    }
}
----
====

Adding this annotation imports other Spring configuration files that add a number of reasonable defaults, such as how tokens ought to be signed, their duration, and what grants to allow.

==== Specifying a Client and Secret

By spec, numerous OAuth 2.0 endpoints require client authentication, so you need to specify at least one client in order for anyone to be able to communicate with your authorization server.

The following example shows how to specify a client:

====
[source,yaml]
----
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      client-id: first-client
      client-secret: noonewilleverguess
----
====

NOTE: While convenient, this makes a number of assumptions that are unlikely to be viable in production.
You likely need to do more than this to ship.

That's it! But, what do you do with it? We cover that next.

==== Retrieving a Token

OAuth 2.0 is essentially a framework that specifies strategies for exchanging long-lived tokens for short-lived ones.

By default, `@EnableAuthorizationServer` grants a client access to client credentials, which means you can do something like the following:

====
[source,bash]
----
curl first-client:noonewilleverguess@localhost:8080/oauth/token -dgrant_type=client_credentials -dscope=any
----
====

The application responds with a token similar to the following:

====
[source,json]
----
{
    "access_token" : "f05a1ea7-4c80-4583-a123-dc7a99415588",
    "token_type" : "bearer",
    "expires_in" : 43173,
    "scope" : "any"
}
----
====

This token can be presented to any resource server that supports opaque OAuth 2.0 tokens and is configured to point at this authorization server for verification.

From here, you can jump to:

* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-disable>>
* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authorization-code-grant>>
* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant>>
* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authentication-manager>>
* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-spring-security-oauth2-resource-server>>
* https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/docs/oauth2.html#jwt-tokens[How to Configure for Jwt Tokens]

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-disable]]
=== How to Switch Off OAuth2 Boot's Auto Configuration

Basically, the OAuth2 Boot project creates an instance of https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/docs/oauth2.html#authorization-server-configuration[`AuthorizationServerConfigurer`] with some reasonable defaults:

* It registers a `NoOpPasswordEncoder` (overriding https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#core-services-password-encoding[the Spring Security default])
* It lets the client you provided use any grant type this server supports: `authorization_code`, `password`, `client_credentials`, `implicit`, or `refresh_token`.

Otherwise, it also tries to pick up a handful of beans, if they are defined -- namely:

* `AuthenticationManager`: For looking up end users (not clients)
* `TokenStore`: For generating and retrieving tokens
* `AccessTokenConverter`: For converting access tokens into different formats, such as JWT.

NOTE: While this documentation covers a bit of what each of these beans does, the https://projects.spring.io/spring-security-oauth/docs/oauth2.html[Spring Security OAuth documentation] is a better place to read up on its primitives

If you expose a bean of type `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`, none of this is done automatically.

So, for example, if you need to configure more than one client, change their allowed grant types, or use something better than the no-op password encoder (highly recommended!), then you want to expose your own `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AuthorizationServerConfig extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    @Autowired DataSource dataSource;

    protected void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients) {
        clients
            .jdbc(this.dataSource)
            .passwordEncoder(PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder());
    }
}
----
====

The preceding configuration causes OAuth2 Boot to no longer retrieve the client from environment properties and now falls back to the Spring Security password encoder default.

From here, you may want to learn more about:

* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authorization-code-grant>>
* <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant>>

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authorization-code-grant]]
=== How to Make Authorization Code Grant Flow Work

With the default configuration, while the Authorization Code Flow is technically allowed, it is not completely configured.

This is because, in addition to what comes pre-configured, the Authorization Code Flow requires:

* End users
* An end-user login flow, and
* A redirect URI registered with the client

==== Adding End Users

In a typical Spring Boot application secured by Spring Security, https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#tech-userdetailsservice[users are defined by a `UserDetailsService`].
In that regard, an authorization server is no different, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Bean
    @Override
    public void UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
            User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
                .username("enduser")
                .password("password")
                .roles("USER")
                .build());
    }
}
----
====

Note that, as is typical of a Spring Security web application, users are defined in a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` instance.

==== Adding an End-User Login Flow

Incidentally, adding an instance of `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` is all we need for now to add a form login flow for end users.
However, note that this is where any other configuration regarding the web application itself, not the OAuth 2.0 API, goes.

If you want to customize the login page, offer more than just form login for the user, or add additional support like password recovery, the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` picks it up.

==== Registering a Redirect URI With the Client

OAuth2 Boot does not support configuring a redirect URI as a property -- say, alongside `client-id` and `client-secret`.

To add a redirect URI, you need to specify the client by using either `InMemoryClientDetailsService` or `JdbcClientDetailsService`.

Doing either means <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-disabled,replacing the OAuth2 Boot-provided `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`>> with your own, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AuthorizationServerConfig extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    @Bean
    PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder();
    }

    protected void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients) {
        clients
            .inMemory()
                .withClient("first-client")
                .secret(passwordEncoder().encode("noonewilleverguess"))
                .scopes("resource:read")
                .authorizedGrantTypes("authorization_code")
                .redirectUris("http://localhost:8081/oauth/login/client-app");
    }
}
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-testing-authorization-code-flow]]
==== Testing Authorization Code Flow

Testing OAuth can be tricky since it requires more than one server to see the full flow in action.
However, the first steps are straight-forward:

. Browse to http://localhost:8080/oauth/authorize?grant_type=authorization_code&response_type=code&client_id=first-client&state=1234
. The application, if the user is not logged in, redirects to the login page, at http://localhost:8080/login
. Once the user logs in, the application generates a code and redirects to the registered redirect URI -- in this case, http://localhost:8081/oauth/login/client-app

The flow could continue at this point by standing up any resource server that is configured for opaque tokens and is pointed at this authorization server instance.

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant]]
=== How to Make Password Grant Flow Work

With the default configuration, while the Password Flow is technically possible, it, like Authorization Code, is missing users.

That said, because the default configuration creates a user with a username of `user` and a randomly-generated password, you can hypothetically check the logs for the password and do the following:

====
[source,bash]
----
curl first-client:noonewilleverguess@localhost:8080/oauth/token -dgrant_type=password -dscope=any -dusername=user -dpassword=the-password-from-the-logs
----
====

When you run that command, you should get a token back.

More likely, though, you want to specify a set of users.

As was stated in <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authorization-code-grant>>, in Spring Security, users are typically specified in a `UserDetailsService` and this application is no different, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Bean
    @Override
    public void UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(
            User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
                .username("enduser")
                .password("password")
                .roles("USER")
                .build());
    }
}
----
====

This is all we need to do. We do not need to override `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`, because the client ID and secret are specified as environment properties.

So, the following should now work:

====
[source,bash]
----
curl first-client:noonewilleverguess@localhost:8080/oauth/token -dgrant_type=password -dscope=any -dusername=enduser -dpassword=password
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-authentication-manager]]
=== How and When to Give Authorization Server an AuthenticationManager

This is a very common question and is not terribly intuitive when `AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer` needs an `AuthenticationManager` instance to be specified.
The short answer is: Only when using <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant,the Resource Owner Password Flow>>.

It helps to remember a few fundamentals:

* An `AuthenticationManager` is an abstraction for authenticating users. It typically needs some kind of `UserDetailsService` to be specified in order to be complete.
* End users are specified in a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`.
* OAuth2 Boot, by default, automatically picks up any exposed `AuthenticationManager`.

However, not all flows require an `AuthenticationManager` because not all flows have end users involved.
For example, the Client Credentials flow asks for a token based only on the client's authority, not the end user's.
And the Refresh Token flow asks for a token based only on the authority of a refresh token.

Also, not all flows specifically require the OAuth 2.0 API itself to have an `AuthenticationManager`, either.
For example, the Authorization Code and Implicit flows verify the user when they login (application flow), not when the token (OAuth 2.0 API) is requested.

Only the Resource Owner Password flow returns a code based off of the end user's credentials.
This means that the Authorization Server only needs an `AuthenticationManager` when clients are using the Resource Owner Password flow.

The following example shows the Resource Owner Password flow:

[source,java]
----
.authorizedGrantTypes("password", ...)
----

In the preceding flow, your Authorization Server needs an instance of `AuthenticationManager`.

There are a few ways to do this (<<boot-features-security-oauth2-authorization-server,remember the fundamentals from earlier>>):

* Leave the OAuth2 Boot defaults (you are not exposing a `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`) and <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-user-details-service,expose a `UserDetailsService`>>.
* Leave the OAuth2 Boot defaults and <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-authentication-manager,expose an `AuthenticationManager`>>.
* Override `AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter` (removing OAuth2 Boot's defaults) and <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-authentication-configuration,depend on `AuthenticationConfiguration`>>.
* Override `AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter` and <<oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-autowired-authentication-manager,manually wire the `AuthenticationManager`>>.

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-user-details-service]]
==== Exposing a `UserDetailsService`

End users are specified in a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` through a `UserDetailsService`.
So, if you use the OAuth2 Boot defaults (meaning you haven't implemented a `AuthorizationServerConfigurer`), you can expose a `UserDetailsService` and be done, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Autowired DataSource dataSource;

    @Bean
    @Override
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new JdbcUserDetailsManager(this.dataSource);
    }
}
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-authentication-manager]]
==== Exposing an `AuthenticationManager`

In case you need to do more specialized configuration of the `AuthenticationManager`, you can do so in the `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` and then expose it, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Bean(BeansId.AUTHENTICATION_MANAGER)
    @Override
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() {
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) {
        auth.authenticationProvider(customAuthenticationProvider());
    }
}
----
====

If you use the OAuth2 Boot defaults, then it picks up the bean automatically.

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-authentication-configuration]]
==== Depending on `AuthenticationConfiguration`

Any configured `AuthenticationManager` is available in `AuthenticationConfiguration`.
This means that, if you need to have an `AuthorizationServerConfigurer` (in which case you need to do your own autowiring), you can have it depend on `AuthenticationConfiguration` to get the `AuthenticationManager` bean, as the following class shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Component
public class CustomAuthorizationServerConfigurer extends
    AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    public CustomAuthorizationServerConfigurer(AuthenticationConfiguration authenticationConfiguration) {
        this.authenticationManager = authenticationConfiguration.getAuthenticationManager();
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients) {
        // .. your client configuration that allows the password grant
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints) {
        endpoints.authenticationManager(authenticationManager);
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Bean
    @Override
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsService() {
        return new MyCustomUserDetailsService();
    }
}
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-password-grant-autowired-authentication-manager]]
==== Manually Wiring An `AuthenticationManager`

In the most sophisticated case, where the `AuthenticationManager` needs special configuration and you have your own `AuthenticationServerConfigurer`, then you need to both create your own `AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter` and your own `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Component
public class CustomAuthorizationServerConfigurer extends
    AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;

    public CustomAuthorizationServerConfigurer(AuthenticationManager authenticationManager) {
        this.authenticationManager = authenticationManager;
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(ClientDetailsServiceConfigurer clients) {
        // .. your client configuration that allows the password grant
    }

    @Override
    public void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints) {
        endpoints.authenticationManager(authenticationManager);
    }
}
----

[source,java]
----
@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Bean(BeansId.AUTHENTICATION_MANAGER)
    @Override
    public AuthenticationManager authenticationManagerBean() {
        return super.authenticationManagerBean();
    }

    @Override
    protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) {
        auth.authenticationProvider(customAuthenticationProvider());
    }
}
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-spring-security-oauth2-resource-server]]
=== Is Authorization Server Compatible with Spring Security 5.1 Resource Server and Client?

No, not out of the box.
Spring Security 5.1 supports only JWT-encoded JWK-signed authorization, and Authorization Server does not ship with a JWK Set URI.

Basic support is possible, though.

In order to configure Authorization Server to be compatible with Spring Security 5.1 Resource Server, for example, you need to do the following:

* Configure it to use JWKs
* Add a JWK Set URI endpoint

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-spring-security-oauth2-resource-server-jwk]]
==== Configuring Authorization Server to Use JWKs

To change the format used for access and refresh tokens, you can change out the `AccessTokenConverter` and the `TokenStore`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@EnableAuthorizationServer
@Configuration
public class JwkSetConfiguration extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

	AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;
	KeyPair keyPair;

	public JwkSetConfiguration(AuthenticationConfiguration authenticationConfiguration,
			KeyPair keyPair) throws Exception {

		this.authenticationManager = authenticationConfiguration.getAuthenticationManager();
		this.keyPair = keyPair;
	}

    // ... client configuration, etc.

	@Override
	public void configure(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfigurer endpoints) {
		// @formatter:off
		endpoints
			.authenticationManager(this.authenticationManager)
			.accessTokenConverter(accessTokenConverter())
			.tokenStore(tokenStore());
		// @formatter:on
	}

	@Bean
	public TokenStore tokenStore() {
		return new JwtTokenStore(accessTokenConverter());
	}

	@Bean
	public JwtAccessTokenConverter accessTokenConverter() {
		JwtAccessTokenConverter converter = new JwtAccessTokenConverter();
		converter.setKeyPair(this.keyPair);
		return converter;
	}
}
----
====

[[oauth2-boot-authorization-server-spring-security-oauth2-resource-server-jwk-set-uri]]
==== Add a JWK Set URI Endpoint

Spring Security OAuth does not support JWKs, nor does `@EnableAuthorizationServer` support adding more OAuth 2.0 API endpoints to its initial set.
However, we can add this with only a few lines.

First, you need to add another dependency: `com.nimbusds:nimbus-jose-jwt`. This gives you the appropriate JWK primitives.

Second, instead of using `@EnableAuthorizationServer`, you need to directlyu include its two `@Configuration` classes:

* `AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfiguration`: The `@Configuration` class for configuring the OAuth 2.0 API endpoints, such as what format to use for the tokens.
* `AuthorizationServerSecurityConfiguration`: The `@Configuration` class for the access rules around those endpoints.
This is the one that you need to extend, as shown in the following example:

====
[source,java]
----
@FrameworkEndpoint
class JwkSetEndpoint {
	KeyPair keyPair;

	public JwkSetEndpoint(KeyPair keyPair) {
		this.keyPair = keyPair;
	}

	@GetMapping("/.well-known/jwks.json")
	@ResponseBody
	public Map<String, Object> getKey(Principal principal) {
		RSAPublicKey publicKey = (RSAPublicKey) this.keyPair.getPublic();
		RSAKey key = new RSAKey.Builder(publicKey).build();
		return new JWKSet(key).toJSONObject();
	}
}
----

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class JwkSetEndpointConfiguration extends AuthorizationServerSecurityConfiguration {
	@Override
	protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
		super.configure(http);
		http
			.requestMatchers()
				.mvcMatchers("/.well-known/jwks.json")
				.and()
			.authorizeRequests()
				.mvcMatchers("/.well-known/jwks.json").permitAll();
	}
}
----
====

Then, since you do not need to change `AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfiguration`, you can `@Import` it instead of using `@EnableAuthorizationServer`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java]
----
@Import(AuthorizationServerEndpointsConfiguration.class)
@Configuration
public class JwkSetConfiguration extends AuthorizationServerConfigurerAdapter {

    // ... the rest of the configuration from the previous section
}
----
====

==== Testing Against Spring Security 5.1 Resource Server

Now you can POST to the `/oauth/token` endpoint (<<oauth2-boot-testing-authorization-code-flow,as before>>) to obtain a token and then present that to a https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/tree/master/samples/boot/oauth2resourceserver[Spring Security 5.1 Resource Server].

[[boot-features-security-oauth2-resource-server]]
== Resource Server

To use the access token, you need a Resource Server (which can be the same as the
Authorization Server). To create a Resource Server, add
`@EnableResourceServer` and provide some configuration to let the server decode
access tokens. If your application is also an Authorization Server, it already knows how
to decode tokens, so there is nothing else to do. If your application is a standalone service,
you need to give it some more configuration, by using one of the following options:

* `security.oauth2.resource.user-info-uri` to use the `/me` resource -- for example,
`\https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/userinfo` on Pivotal Web Services (PWS).

* `security.oauth2.resource.token-info-uri` to use the token decoding endpoint -- for example
`\https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/check_token` on PWS.

If you specify both the `user-info-uri` and the `token-info-uri`, you can set the `prefer-token-info` flag
to specify that one is preferred over the other (`prefer-token-info=true` is the default).

Alternatively (instead of `user-info-uri` or `token-info-uri`), if the tokens are JWTs, you
can configure a `security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-value` to decode them locally (where the
key is a verification key). The verification key value is either a symmetric secret or
PEM-encoded RSA public key. If you do not have the key and it is public, you can provide a
URI from which it can be downloaded (as a JSON object with a `value` field) with
`security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-uri`. For example, on PWS, you could do the following:

====
[indent=0]
----
  $ curl https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/token_key
  {"alg":"SHA256withRSA","value":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBI...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"}
----
====

Additionally, if your authorization server has an endpoint that returns a set of JSON Web
Keys(JWKs), you can configure `security.oauth2.resource.jwk.key-set-uri`. For example, on PWS, you could do the following:

====
[indent=0]
----
  $ curl https://uaa.run.pivotal.io/token_keys
  {"keys":[{"kid":"key-1","alg":"RS256","value":"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\nMIIBI...\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----\n"]}
----
====

CAUTION: Configuring both JWT and JWK properties causes an error. You should configure only one of
`security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-uri` (or `security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-value`) and
`security.oauth2.resource.jwk.key-set-uri`.

CAUTION: If you use the `security.oauth2.resource.jwt.key-uri` or
`security.oauth2.resource.jwk.key-set-uri`, the authorization server needs to be running
when your application starts up. It logs a warning if it cannot find the key and tells
you what to do to fix it.

OAuth2 resources are protected by a filter chain with the order specified by
`security.oauth2.resource.filter-order`. The default is, after the filter, protecting the
actuator endpoints (so actuator endpoints stay on HTTP Basic unless you
change the order).

[[boot-features-security-oauth2-token-type]]
=== Token Type in User Info
Google and certain other third-party identity providers are more strict about the token
type name that is sent in the headers to the user info endpoint. The default is `Bearer`,
which suits most providers and matches the spec. However, if you need to change it, you can set
`security.oauth2.resource.token-type`.

[[boot-features-security-custom-user-info]]
=== Customizing the User Info RestTemplate

If you have a `user-info-uri`, the resource server features use an `OAuth2RestTemplate`
internally to fetch user details for authentication. This is provided as a `@Bean` of
type `UserInfoRestTemplateFactory`. The default should be fine for most providers, but
(occasionally) you might need to add additional interceptors or change the request
authenticator (which is how the token gets attached to outgoing requests). To add a
customization, you can create a bean of type `UserInfoRestTemplateCustomizer`. It has a
single method that is called after the bean is created but before it is initialized.
The rest template that is being customized here is used only internally to carry out
authentication. Alternatively, you could define your own `UserInfoRestTemplateFactory`
`@Bean` to take full control.

[TIP]
====
To set an RSA key value in YAML, you can use the `pipe` continuation marker (`|`) to split it over
multiple lines and remember to indent the key value (it is a standard YAML
language feature). The following example shows how to do so:

=====
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
  security:
    oauth2:
      resource:
        jwt:
          keyValue: |
            -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
            MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKC...
            -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----
=====
====



[[boot-features-security-custom-user-info-client]]
== Client

To make your web application into an OAuth2 client, you can add `@EnableOAuth2Client` and
Spring Boot creates an `OAuth2ClientContext` and `OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails` that
are necessary to create an `OAuth2RestOperations`. Spring Boot does not automatically
create such a bean, but you can easily create your own, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----

    @Bean
    public OAuth2RestTemplate oauth2RestTemplate(OAuth2ClientContext oauth2ClientContext,
            OAuth2ProtectedResourceDetails details) {
        return new OAuth2RestTemplate(details, oauth2ClientContext);
    }
----
====

NOTE: You may want to add a qualifier and review your configuration, as more than one
`RestTemplate` may be defined in your application.

This configuration uses `security.oauth2.client.*` as credentials (the same as you might
be using in the Authorization Server). However, in addition, it needs to know the
authorization and token URIs in the Authorization Server, as the following example shows:

====
.application.yml
[source,yaml,indent=0]
----
security:
  oauth2:
    client:
      clientId: bd1c0a783ccdd1c9b9e4
      clientSecret: 1a9030fbca47a5b2c28e92f19050bb77824b5ad1
      accessTokenUri: https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token
      userAuthorizationUri: https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize
      clientAuthenticationScheme: form
----
====

An application with this configuration redirects to Github for authorization when you
attempt to use the `OAuth2RestTemplate`. If you are already signed into Github. you should not
even notice that it has authenticated.  These specific credentials work only if your
application is running on port 8080 (you can register your own client application in Github or other
provider for more flexibility).

To limit the scope that the client asks for when it obtains an access token, you can set
`security.oauth2.client.scope` (comma separated or an array in YAML). By default, the scope
is empty, and it is up to Authorization Server to decide what the defaults should be
(usually depending on the settings in the client registration that it holds).

NOTE: There is also a setting for `security.oauth2.client.client-authentication-scheme`,
which defaults to `header` (but you might need to set it to `form` if, like Github for
instance, your OAuth2 provider does not like header authentication). In fact, the
`security.oauth2.client.*` properties are bound to an instance of
`AuthorizationCodeResourceDetails`, so all of its properties can be specified.

TIP: In a non-web application, you can still create an `OAuth2RestOperations`, and it
is still wired into the `security.oauth2.client.*` configuration. In this case, you are asking for is a
"`client credentials token grant`" if you use it (and there is no
need to use `@EnableOAuth2Client` or `@EnableOAuth2Sso`). To prevent that infrastructure
being defined, remove the `security.oauth2.client.client-id` from your configuration
(or make it be an empty string).

[[boot-features-security-oauth2-single-sign-on]]
== Single Sign On

You can use an OAuth2 Client to fetch user details from the provider (if such features are
available) and then convert them into an `Authentication` token for Spring Security.
The Resource Server (<<boot-features-security-oauth2-resource-server,described earlier>>) supports this through the `user-info-uri` property. This is the basis
for a Single Sign On (SSO) protocol based on OAuth2, and Spring Boot makes it easy to
participate by providing an annotation `@EnableOAuth2Sso`. The Github client shown in the preceding section can
protect all its resources and authenticate by using the Github `/user/` endpoint, by adding
that annotation and declaring where to find the endpoint (in addition to the
`security.oauth2.client.*` configuration already listed earlier):

.application.yml
====
[source,yaml,indent=0]]
----
security:
  oauth2:
# ...
  resource:
    userInfoUri: https://api.github.com/user
    preferTokenInfo: false
----
====

Since all paths are secure by default, there is no "`home`" page that you can show to
unauthenticated users and invite them to login (by visiting the `/login` path, or the
path specified by `security.oauth2.sso.login-path`).

To customize the access rules or paths to protect s(o you can add a "`home`" page for
instance,) you can add `@EnableOAuth2Sso` to a `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`. The
annotation causes it to be decorated and enhanced with the necessary pieces to get
the `/login` path working. In the following example, we simply allow unauthenticated access
to the home page at `/` and keep the default for everything else:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .mvcMatchers("/").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}
----
====

Also, note that, since all endpoints are secure by default, this includes any default
error handling endpoints -- for example, the `/error` endpoint. This means that, if
there is some problem during Single Sign On that requires the application to redirect
to the `/error` page, this can cause an infinite redirect between the identity
provider and the receiving application.

First, think carefully about making an endpoint insecure, as you may find that the
behavior is simply evidence of a different problem. However, this behavior can be
addressed by configuring the application to permit `/error`, as the following example shows:

====
[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Configuration
public class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/error").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated();
    }
}

[[common-application-properties]]
== Common Application Properties
You can specify various properties inside your `application.properties` or `application.yml`
files or as command line switches. This section provides a list of common Spring Boot
properties and references to the underlying classes that consume them.

NOTE: Property contributions can come from additional jar files on your classpath, so
you should not consider this an exhaustive list. It is also perfectly legitimate to define
your own properties.

WARNING: This sample file is meant as a guide only. Do **not** copy and paste the entire
content into your application. Rather, pick only the properties that you need.
